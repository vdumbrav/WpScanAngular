    <h3>BYPASS</h3>
    <p>Bypass, in general, means either to go around something by an external route rather than going through it, or the means
      of accomplishing that feat. In network security, a bypass is a flaw in a security system that allows an attacker to
      circumvent security mechanisms to get system or network access. The actual point of entry is through a mechanism (either
      a hardware device or program, even just a piece of code) that enables the user to access the system without going through
      the security clearance procedures (such as authentication) that were set up by the system administrator. A bypass may
      be a mechanism put in place by an attacker, a flaw in the design, or an alternate access route left in place by developers.
      A bypass that is purposefully put in place as a means of access for authorized users is called a back door or a trap
      door. A crypto bypass is a flaw that allows data to circumvent the encryption process and escape, unencrypted, as plaintext.</p>

    <h3>CSRF</h3>
    <p>Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF (sometimes pronounced
      sea-surf) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user
      that the web application trusts. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular
      site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.</p>

    <h3>DOS</h3>
    <p>denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack where the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource
      unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.
      Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests
      in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>FPD</h3>
    <p>Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/.
      Certain vulnerabilities, such as using the load_file() (within a SQL Injection) query to view the page source, require
      the attacker to have the full path to the file they wish to view.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>LFI</h3>
    <p>A File inclusion vulnerability is a type of vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that
      rely on a scripting run time. This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled
      variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. A file include vulnerability
      is distinct from a generic Directory Traversal Attack, in that directory traversal is a way of gaining unauthorized
      file system access, and a file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution. Successful
      exploitation of a file include vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected
      web application.</p>

    <h3>RCE</h3>
    <p>Remote code execution is the ability an attacker has to access someone else's computing device and make changes, no matter
      where the device is geographically located. </p>

    <h3>RFI</h3>
    <p>Remote file inclusion (RFI) is an attack targeting vulnerabilities in web applications that dynamically reference external
      scripts. The perpetrator's goal is to exploit the referencing function in an application to upload malware (e.g., backdoor
      shells) from a remote URL located within a different domain.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>SQLI</h3>
    <p>SQL Injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which nefarious SQL statements
      are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker). SQL injection
      must exploit a security vulnerability in an application's software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly
      filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly
      executed. SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL
      database.

    <h3>SSRF</h3>
    <p>Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that appears when an attacker has the ability to create requests
      from the vulnerable server. Usually, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks target internal systems behind the
      firewall that are normally inaccessible from the outside world (but using SSRF it’s possible to access these systems).
      With SSRF it’s also possible to access services from the same server that is listening on the loopback interface.</p>

    <h3>XSS</h3>
    <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables
      attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability
      may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out
      on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007. Their effect
      may range from a petty nuisance to a significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by
      the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner.</p>

    <h3>XXE</h3>
    <p>An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when
      XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack
      may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from
      the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.</p>
